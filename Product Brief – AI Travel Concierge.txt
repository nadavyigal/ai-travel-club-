Product Brief – AI Travel Concierge (Amended with PMF Insights)
1. Vision

To redefine travel booking by replacing search and comparison with trusted, AI-powered trip creation — so travelers can focus on experiences, not logistics.

We envision a world where planning a trip is as simple as telling your AI concierge, “I want to go to Rome in October with my friends,” and instantly receiving a curated, guaranteed, and bookable journey.

2. Mission

To become the world’s most trusted AI travel concierge by:

Eliminating planning chaos with conversational AI that transforms intent into curated itineraries.

Restoring trust in travel booking through transparent price guarantees, auto-rebooking, and verified reviews.

Making travel collaborative with group boards, consensus tools, and shared payments.

Unlocking unique experiences by bundling live events, restaurants, and local gems alongside flights and stays.

Aligning incentives with a hybrid business model that lets travelers pay fairly — subscription for frequent users, per-trip for casuals, and “only-if-we-save-you” for skeptics.
