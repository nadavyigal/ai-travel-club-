Executive summary (desk research + modeling)

Subscription is viable in travel: eDreams Prime has ~7.25–7.5M paying members and now contributes ~71–75% of company revenue, validating that travelers will pay for recurring benefits tied to savings and service. Typical publicly cited fees range ~€55–€100/year depending on market/tier.

Reference prices travelers already accept: TripIt Pro is $49/year for alerting/assistance; Frontier’s Discount Den is $59.99/year (first year often $99.99 incl. fee); Hopper Premium advertises $9.99/month with credits. These anchor realistic WTP bands for planning/assurance benefits.

“Guarantees” must be real: Google Flights’ Price Guarantee is narrowly available and pays the drop after take-off and with booking caps—users have learned to distrust vague guarantees. Hopper now leans on Price Freeze (non-refundable deposit; capped coverage) rather than broad “price-drop refunds.” Travelers will pay for guarantees, but only with clear caps, audit trails, and fast refunds.

Regulatory winds favor transparency: “All-in pricing” expectations (e.g., Ticketmaster moving to display full prices ahead of FTC junk-fee ban) raise the bar for checkout trust; mirroring this in travel improves conversion and WTP. 
The Verge

Headline recommendation: Launch with a hybrid model that offers (1) a low-friction Per-Trip Pass, (2) an Annual plan for frequent travelers, and (3) an optional Savings-Share for “only-if-you-save-me” users—each tied to a verifiable price guarantee + auto-rebooking and group collaboration. Price where travelers already show comfort: Trip Pass $7–$15; Annual $69–$99; Monthly $9–$15; Savings-Share 10–15% of verified savings, capped at $50–$100/trip. (Ranges derived from competitor anchors above and qualitative trust constraints.)

Proposed hybrid pricing & why it works

1) Per-Trip Pass (low-frequency users, groups trying the product)

$7–$15 per trip (party-wide), includes:
A. Price Guarantee (refund to original payment, cap $50–$100),
B. Auto-rebooking on price drops/cancellations with consent,
C. Group board + polls/AI consensus,
D. Live event bundling access.

Why: Mirrors the perceived fairness of paying only when you book; aligns with TripIt/Hopper ad-hoc add-ons but adds deterministic value (guarantee + rebooking). Anchors to known willingness (<$15 one-time).

2) Annual / Monthly Subscription (frequent travelers, planners-in-chief)

Monthly: $9–$15 (cancel any time). Annual: $69–$99.

Includes everything in Trip Pass + higher guarantee caps, multi-trip auto-rebooking, priority event access, and concierge escalation.

Why: Price bands align with Hopper Premium ($9.99/mo) and eDreams Prime (€55–€100/yr) where the market already pays. Offer family/group sharing to amplify value.

3) Savings-Share (trust-first option)

10–15% of verified savings, cap $50–$100/trip, no savings → no fee.

Savings = difference vs. a time-stamped baseline (logged OTA/airline screenshots & GDS quotes).

Why: Converts skeptics; “only pay if we save you” reduces perceived risk while caps prevent bill shock—addressing distrust seen with vague “guarantees.” 
Thrifty Traveler

Free tier (lead magnet, minimal leakage)

Unlimited planning chat, trip boards, and event discovery; booking requires Trip Pass/Subscription/Savings-Share.

Prevents pre-booking leakage by holding the most valuable parts (guarantee, auto-rebooking, ticket protections) for paid users.

Feature–value mapping (what actually drives payment)

Top pay drivers (to gate behind paid):

Price Guarantee with clear caps and refund-to-card (not wallet-only).

Auto-rebooking (drops/cancellations) with audit trail and opt-outs.

Group collaboration & AI consensus that saves time & conflict.

Event bundling (sports/shows) with all-in pricing at checkout. (Regulatory momentum makes this a visible trust win.) 
The Verge

Credibility levers:

Savings audit receipt (time-stamped quotes; calcs; cap shown).

Refund timing promise (e.g., 3–5 banking days vs. “after travel”). Contrast Google’s post-flight refunds.

Segment take & price tolerance (modeled from comps)

Frequent travelers (4+ trips/yr; planners-in-chief): skew to Annual $79–$99 or Monthly $12–$15; high value on auto-rebooking + concierge + calendar/loyalty syncing. Anchor: eDreams Prime scale + TripIt Pro utility. 
Cinco Días
+1

Couples & families (2–3 trips/yr): Per-Trip $9–$12 attractive; consider Family Annual $89–$119 with shared caps and priority event holds.

Friend groups (event-led): Per-Trip $12–$15 if guarantees and group tools are party-wide.

Occasional travelers (≤1 trip/yr): prefer Savings-Share 10–15%, capped $50–$75.

Pricing page & paywall copy

“Only pay when it pays: choose Trip Pass, Annual, or ‘Only-if-we-save-you’.”

Show expected savings and cap before purchase; provide a sample audit.

Placement experiments (ship all three):

Flow A (Monthly/Annual upfront) for frequent-trip intent.

Flow B (Trip Pass at ‘Finalize itinerary’) for casuals/groups.

Flow C (Savings-Share after we surface a specific saving) to nudge skeptics; enforce caps visibly.

Guarantee policy (MVP):

“If we find a better price on the same itinerary before check-in we auto-rebook or refund the difference to your card up to $100/trip (Annual: $200). You always see the math.”

Distinct from Google’s post-flight refunds; faster + clearer.

What to measure

Attach rate by segment (Trip Pass vs. Annual vs. Savings-Share).

Net $/trip and ARPU; refund issuance latency; chargeback rate.

Perceived fairness and trust (5-item Likert) post-checkout.

Explicit Savings-Share acceptability at 5/10/15/20% + cap choices.

Scenario cards: friends + event; family beach w/ apartment; couple + concert.

B. Choice-based conjoint (CBC)

Attributes: Model (Sub/Annual/Trip/S-Share/Hybrid), Price, Guarantee strength, Auto-rebooking, Group collab depth, Event access, Support level, Privacy mode.

Use HB to simulate share across your three SKUs.

C. Prototype tests (A/B)

Compare Flow A/B/C above; track take-rate, abandonment, refund sentiment.

Launch-ready price card (v1)

Trip Pass: $9.99 per trip → Price Guarantee up to $100, Auto-rebooking, Group AI board, Event bundles.

Annual: $89/year (or $12.99/mo cancel anytime) → Higher caps ($200), 24/7 escalation, Family sharing (up to 6), Priority event holds.
